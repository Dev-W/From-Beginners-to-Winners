Welcome to our GitHub page!
This is the place where we will all brainstorm ideas to create a challenge using HTML.
If you haven't already, please create a GitHub account. This way I can add you as a Collaborator to our project.
Please be patient if you are not added immediately to our project. You will be added so no worries.
In the meantime, I advise learning about Github and HTML as well. 
Also, we will be creating other challenges and/or projects using other programming languages in the future.
Everyone here can add notes or files to this project. 
Am looking forward to everyone's wonderful ideas.
